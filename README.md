# modelling work by Andre

## Setting up

- `pip install pre-commit`
- `pre-commit install`
- `pip install -r code/requirements.txt`

This repository is used to synchronize the work I have done and to be able to easily transfer it to other GitLab repos if it turns out to be necessary. 

It is initialized by parts of the GitLab repositories:
* CyclicPhotosyn 2021 (https://gitlab.com/qtb-hhu/models/cyclicphotosyn-2021) and
* qtb-hhu/Photosynthesis Task Force (https://gitlab.com/qtb-hhu/photosynthesis-task-force/project-template)
to get some running code as templates and a predefined structure I will try to stick to.
